### Security encryption and Performance of the transmission data/messages by - Convolutional Ecoder , direct sequence spread spectrum , Viterbi Decoder , Very powerful error correction capability .
### Attaching down the block design diagram of the whole System :

### Each block is built using the following techniques.

### Source Coding: Convolution using modulo 2.

### Channel Coding: Convolutional encoding .

### Modulation: Frequency-shift keying (Fsk /Gfsk) modulation.

### Channel: Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel (AWGN) .

### Demodulation: FSK demodulation

### Channel Decoding: Viterbi decoding

### Source Decoding: Hamming Distance Decoding - Hybrid Decoding over hard decision with soft decision.

##

### the Viterbi Decoder(K=7, code rate = 1/2) is used for decoding the encrypted data and its implementation is based on Maximum likelihood estimation and stochastic approximation.

### Instructions
### Project is done by Matlab, and C/C++ languags. it works for two operating systems (Windows/Linux). To run the the program download it and run it by writing in your IDE :  
### Matlab - Decryption('filepath of your sampled data'). 
### C/C++ - Viterbi ('filepath of your sampled data').

### -Output is your sent message/Data.
